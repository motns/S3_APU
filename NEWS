S3 APU 1.2.6.3 - 09/02/2010
============================

Major internal changes and New features
----------------------------------------
* Worker no longer uses Multi cURL internally. Instead it was replaced by
sequential cURL calls, which solved the issue of high CPU usage while uploading
to S3

* Added support for COPY operations within S3


Minor features
---------------
* Added library extension and utility for retrieving META headers for
an S3 object

* Added alternative listing utility, for lexical key-based object listing. This
is essentially a standard listing utility that uses no separator

* PID files are now stored under "/var/run" by default (configurable)

* Logging of unexpected errors during instruction handling in the Worker

* More solid regular-expression based instruction validation in Queue Daemon.
This is for added security and stability in environments where external (not S3
APU based) services are adding items to the Queue

* Standard list utility can now list from an alternative bucket


Bug fixes
----------
* Communication errors during the cURL perform phase are now caught

* Common prefixes are now included in the standard S3 listing output

* The Worker no longer skips a whole block of instructions, if there's just a
single missing file in there
